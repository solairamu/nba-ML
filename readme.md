# NBA Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based machine learning application designed to forecast NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) recipients. Utilizing advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, the model predicts the top 5 MVP candidates with an impressive accuracy rate. The data spans from 1991 to 2022 and will be updated with each new NBA season, allowing predictions for past, present and future MVPs.

## Features

Historical/Current/Future Predictive Analysis: This tool is not just a historical database but a forward-looking predictor, capable of analyzing trends and performances from 1991 to 2022 and beyond.

Dyanmic Data Update: Capable of incorporating new data each season for predictions. This feature ensures that the model stays relevant and accurate, adapting to the latest trends and performances in the league.

Comprehensive Data Collection & Handling: Utilizes Selenium for web scraping, gathering detailed player and team statistics along with historical MVP voting records. This is complemented by Pandas for efficient data cleaning and preparation

High Accuracy: Achieves approximately 75% precision in predicting MVP candidates using Random Forests. Note: This shows one of the drawbacks in using math in sports as often awards are heavily influnced by factors such as the narrativem, stories, and emotions. Which are hard to mathematically model and predict.

Algorithmic Experimentation: Explores and implements a variety of algorithms through scikit-learn, including but not limited to linear regressions and random forest generators. The choice of algorithms is backed by rigorous error rate analysis, ensuring the most effective model is employed for predictions.

User-Friendly Functionality: Includes a function in the machine learning notebook for generating predictions for a specified year, for which anyone can easily use without any background knowledge.
